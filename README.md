## Introduction
---------------

Hi this is our AI-Based Recipe and Meal Planning App,a mobile application designed to provide personalized meal plans and recipes based on users' dietary preferences and restrictions. This project is our BSc of Honors in Software Engineering graduation project, and we're excited to bring this innovative idea to life.

## Project Overview
-------------------

Our app aims to revolutionize the way people plan and prepare meals by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. With a user-friendly interface and robust backend, our app will provide:

* **Personalized meal plans** based on users' dietary needs and preferences
* **Recipe suggestions** with step-by-step cooking instructions
* **Grocery lists** with automatic generation and categorization
* **AI-powered recipe recommendations** for users with similar preferences

## Development Status

We're just getting started! This repository will serve as the central hub for our project's development. As we progress, you'll see updates to this README, new code commits, and exciting features being added to the app.
